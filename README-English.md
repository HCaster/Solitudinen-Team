# Solitudinem

Language : [English](./README-English.md) | [简体中文](./README.md)

*My English is not very good, please forgive my poor translation (the English README is made by the author himself), in addition there may be some differences in the content of the README in different languages, but this is definitely not discrimination.* 

## Basic introduction



1. This modpack was handed over to me by my friend for academic reasons. 
2. The name comes from the Latin: Solitudinem, but I don't know any Latin, so I guess the original author(Ruang_Feng) probably wanted to take the English meaning of Solitude when naming it.
3. The main author ([FaulknerWu](https://github.com/FaulknerWu)) is in the process of sprinting for NOIP and will not update for now(maybe).

## Known problems



1. UI conflict, has been configured to minimize the problem, if you find more serious UI conflict, please feedback or PR, for information display (ingameinfoxml) feel obtrusive players can type the command `/igi disable`.
2. According to some testers' feedback, there is a lag problem, but it was not found when the author tested the problem. Please stay alert and if lag occurs, please remember the environment where the lag occurred more completely so that the author can test and fix it.
3. Using the "death info" (gravestone:death_info) that comes with respawning after death has a chance of crashing, and has been configured to disable the "death info" that comes with respawning.
